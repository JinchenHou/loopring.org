                                    automated trade execution system that intelligently implements their trades across
                                    the world’s
                                    crypto exchanges, shielding them from counterparty risk and reducing their trading

                                <p>Loopring intermediates trust between blockchains and exchanges, allowing
                                    trading members to retain custody of their funds. For ERC20 tokens initially.</p>

                                    decentralized mechanism and its attributes, order will not be prioritized by the
                                    time.</p>
