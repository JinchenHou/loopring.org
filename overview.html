                    <p class="animateMe2">Loopring is a decentralized token exchange protocol. It is implemented
                        as an ethereum smart-contract at the core of the loopring decentralized
                        exchange system. Its design allows for several improvements over traditional
                        centralized exchanges:</p>
                    <ul class="animateMe2">
                        <li><strong>Reduced Counterparty & Exchange Risk:</strong> Removing the risk
                            of depositing and storing digital assets on a third party exchange and
                            tokens are never locked by orders.</li>
                        <li><strong>High liquidity:</strong> Orders are ring-matched allowing for high
                            liquidity on any trading pair.</li>
                        <li><strong>Fairness:</strong> The fee & discount model allows for fairness
                            between all parties involved (Makers, Takers and Miners).</li>
                        <li><strong>Weak Supervision:</strong> The whole system is completely decentralized.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="animateMe2">You can learn more about the background and general design of the loopring
                        protocol in our whitepaper. Bear in mind that as we proceed with the implementation,
                        some details in the whitepaper might become outdated. Whenever there is
                        a difference, please refer to this website as the latest official update.</p>

                            they interact with each other. They jointly provide all functionalities
                            a centralized exchange has to offer. For a more in depth explanation of

                            and ring miners. Ring-mining is a feature of relayers. It is computational
                            heavy and is done completely off-chain. The process produces chains of
                            trades involving at least 2 tokens, we call that an <a href="https://docs.loopring.org/English/projects/protocol/#order-ring">order ring.</a>

                    Protocol Smart Contracts:</strong></a> a set of smart
                            contracts that checks ring-matched orders received from the miners, do
                            the token transfers on behalf of the users, incentivize the miners and
                            emit events. The relayers/order browsers listen to these events to keep
                            their orderbooks and trade history up to date.</p>

                            services ran by trustworthy companies or organizations. A user could deposit
                            his assets (fiat or tokens from other chains) and get tokens issued. By
                            returning the tokens the user gets back his deposit. LRC is not a cross-chain
                            exchange protocol, but with Asset Tokenization Services, it is possible
                            to trade Ethereum ERC20 tokens with physical assets as well as assets on

                            <img class="animateMe2" src="images/developer-1.png"
                            alt="Developer 101 Fig 1.0">
                            <p class="animateMe2"><strong>The user wants to make a trade:</strong> The user wants to exchange
                                X amount of TokenA for Yamount of TokenB. The current rate and orderbook
                                for this pair can be found on multiple sources provided by the relayers
                                or any other interface hooked up on the network (e.g. orderbook browsers).
                                Once he is ready, he uses his wallet interface to enter the details of
                                his order and submits it. An amount of LRC can be added to the order as
                                a fee for miners. Orders with a higher LRC fee have a better chance to
                                be processed earlier by miners.</p>
                            <p class="animateMe2"><strong>ERC20 Authorization:</strong> The wallet authorizes the loopring
                                smart contracts to handle X amount of the TokenA the user wants to sell.
                                This does not lock the user's tokens. He is free to move them while the
                                order is being processed by the network. If the sender's balance is being
                                checked at some point (by a miner or the loopring) and the funds are insufficient,
                                it will be considered scaled-down. An order being scaled-down is not the
                                same as being cancelled: a scaled-down order will be automatically scaled
                                up to its original size if sufficient funds are deposited to its address,
                                while cancellation is a one way manual operation and cannot be reversed.</p>
                            <p
                            class="animateMe2"><strong>Sending the order to the network:</strong> Once the authorization
                                is made, the order's data is signed with the private key of the sender.
                                Then, the wallet sends the order along with its signature to one or more
                                nodes in the network (relayer).</p>
                                <p class="animateMe2"><strong>Broadcast:</strong> On the reception of the order, relayers update
                                    their public orderbook and broadcast the order to other relayers as well
                                    as ring miners to start the order processing as quickly as possible.</p>
                                <p
                                class="animateMe2"><strong>Ring Miners (order matching):</strong> Ring Miners receive the
                                    order and add it to their orderbook. Each one of them tries to fill it
                                    fully or partially at the given exchange rate or better by ring-matching
                                    it with multiple other orders. The ring-matching is the main reason why
                                    the protocol is able to provide high liquidity over any pair. If the rate
                                    is better than the rate the user asked for, the savings are shared amongst
                                    all the orders in the ring and is called the Margin Split. For his reward
                                    (fee), the miner can choose between claiming the Margin Split and giving
                                    back the LRC to the user, or just keeping the LRC fee.</p>
                                    <p class="animateMe2"><strong>Validation &amp; Settlement:</strong> The ring is received by the
                                        loopring protocol contract. It makes multiple checks to verify the miner's
                                        supplied data and determines if the ring can be settled fully or partially
                                        (depending on the fill rate of the orders in the ring and the tokens in
                                        the users' wallets). If all checks are successful, the contract makes the
                                        token transfers to the users (5a) and pays the miner's fees (5b) at the
                                        same time. This operation is automatic.</p>

                                     <h3 class="animateMe2">Issues with centralized exchanges</h3>

                                    <p class="animateMe2">To better understand the need for a system such as loopring, we first
                                        need to point out the flaws in the centralized exchange model. Here is
                                        a very simplified view of what happens when you send your tokens to a centralized
                                        exchange.</p>
                                    <img class="animateMe2" src="images/developer-2.png" alt="Developer 101 Fig 2.0">
                                    <p class="animateMe2">In order to use the exchange and trade your tokens, you first have to
                                        deposit your tokens in the exchange. Your tokens are sent to the exchange's
                                        wallets and it gives you back an IOU (I owe you), which is a proof of debt.
                                        Then you trade your IOU with other users' IOUs. Finally, when you want
                                        to withdraw, you give back your IOU to the exchange which then sends you
                                        back your tokens to your external wallet address.</p>
                                    <p class="animateMe2"><strong>Lack of Security:</strong> In this model, you don't have control
                                        over your tokens. It allows for instant transactions on the exchange but
                                        it comes with a lot of risks. There are multiple scenarios where you could
                                        loose your money (frozen account, exchange shutting down, hacking, developer's
                                        mistakes, etc...).</p>
                                    <p class="animateMe2"><strong>Lack of Transparency:</strong> Anything can happen to your tokens
                                        when they are on the exchange's wallets. You have no way of knowing what
                                        exactly is happening to your assets. It is always too late when an exchange
                                        goes bankrupt and users never see it coming.</p>
                                    <p class="animateMe2"><strong>Lack of Liquidity:</strong> You are only able to trade with the
                                        exchange's own order pools and supported token pairs. If there is not enough
                                        volume, you can try a different exchange, and if the token pair you want
                                        to trade is not supported, you could try making indirect (intermediate)
                                        trades with other pairs to get what you want or, again, transfer your funds
                                        to another exchange. Either way, you get hit multiple times by fees and
                                        lose money.</p>
                                    <p class="animateMe2">There are other challenges faced by centralized exchanges. We won't discuss
                                        them all here, but we advise you to read the many articles written on the
                                        subject across the web.</p>
