                            <p>When we think of buying goods or services, we think of the price — the dollar cost. Similarly, when we think of trading financial assets, we measure their value in dollars, attaching a price to every security.</p>
                            <p>
                                What’s interesting to note is that in FX markets, we do not refer to the ‘costs’ as a price, but as an exchange rate...</p>

                            <p>Financial markets are enormously important in today’s societies, yet many of us don’t know or care how they ‘work’ — they’re just something that chugs along in the background.</p>

                                This Loopring Learning Series is meant to act as a basic primer of economic concepts related to the protocol, but also to financial markets in general...</p>

                            <p>The crypto markets are generally in the red, but Loopring (LRC) has overcome the generally downward direction to be trading at $0.70 and up 4.98% in 24 hours. The reason for this good performance amidst the general decline in the crypto markets is the announcement that LRC is now available for trading on the popular South Korean exchange, Bithumb...</p>

                            <p>Loopring initially launched on the Ethereum blockchain with the intention of branching out to other blockchains. As a part of launching the platform on additional blockchains, they are launching tokens on each of those platforms.
