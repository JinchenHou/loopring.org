AirSwap protocol serves a growing demand for a decentralized asset exchange on the Ethereum network. Blockchain-based order books, while novel and certainly within the ethos of our ecosystem, have limitations that we believe ultimately make it difficult for them to compete with currently available centralized solutions. Swap provides a method that is both decentralized and unaffected by these limitations. By implementing the protocol, participants gain access to liquidity in a scalable, private, and fair way, without sacrificing access to great pricing. The protocol and APIs are extensible and we encourage the community to build applications with us. We welcome feedback and look forward to pushing the Ethereum community forward with you.
