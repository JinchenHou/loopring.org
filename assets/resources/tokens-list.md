The use of the blockchain is not free, and requires that the user spends a token called AE. AE are used as payment for any resources one consumes on the platform, as well as the basis for financial applications implemented on the platform. All system fees get paid with AE, all smart contracts settle in AE.

When was this virtual currency first introduced?
2017-06-09

What is the history of this virtual currency?
Aeternity was created back in June 2017. Aeternity scales through state channels that run smart contracts. It introduces a new language that supports formal verification and allows to write simpler, safer code. The VM accommodates compiled solidity contracts. Aeternity uses an ASIC-resistant, memory-bound Proof-of-Work (PoW) with less than 15 seconds block time. It features an integrated naming system and oracles, which could be used to request and access data from various data providers. Most importantly, all components are native features of the Aeternity system. They are not meta layers on top of a blockchain (like Lightning, Raiden, Oraclize), but parts of the core protocol. This ensures unmatched efficiency and significantly reduces the cost of running smart contracts and making lightning fast transactions.

When was this virtual currency first introduced?
2017-10-18

What is the history of this virtual currency?
AirSwap protocol serves a growing demand for a decentralized asset exchange on the Ethereum network. Blockchain-based order books, while novel and certainly within the ethos of our ecosystem, have limitations that we believe ultimately make it difficult for them to compete with currently available centralized solutions. Swap provides a method that is both decentralized and unaffected by these limitations. By implementing the protocol, participants gain access to liquidity in a scalable, private, and fair way, without sacrificing access to great pricing. The protocol and APIs are extensible and we encourage the community to build applications with us. We welcome feedback and look forward to pushing the Ethereum community forward with you.
